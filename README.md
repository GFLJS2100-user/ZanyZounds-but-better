# About ZanyZounds

ZanyZounds is a code IDE based on Bytebeat code to generate waves and music! This can be used to make 8-bit music, stereo music and more!

# How to use it

How do you use ZanyZounds? It's easy! Although to get the whole data of ZanyZounds you have to go to the wiki. For example, type "t^t>>8" at 8000hz for an example xor code sequence. But then after that, you have to make the beats and the kicks. Type something like this for the sound base. "(4E3/(t&4095))" is a beat sound base for ZanyZounds. And now for the kick! For the kick all you gotta do is just type a cbrt math. For example, "512*(cbrt(t%4096))" would work if you wanted a kick sound type. And that's all for today!
